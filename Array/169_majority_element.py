# Method 3: Better one and Q is based on this only.

# Algo: (Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm)
# Just you have to find the winner on election.(No chance of draw)

# basic meaning: just cancel each other vote.
# it gives the majority ele i.e that has occured more than n/2 times
# by balancing the count i.e after seeing any other element, it 
# decreases the count if count is zero and  'm' is not equal to the current element.
# at alst 'm' will give the majority element

# note vvi: only valid for majority ele if they occur for sure. will not give the ele which has occured maximum no of times
# if the max_fre ele occur at the start then count will get decrement to '0' later and 'm' will have different ele at last
# then will give incorrect ans 

# Time: O(n) , space : O(1)

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n= len(nums)

                cnt+= 1

                else:  # else decrease the count by 1
                    cnt-= 1

# Mthod 4: Another way of writing the same logic
# More logical and better

# Logic: Since majority element already exist, every ele has two choice:
# 1) it can be same as cur majority element
# 2) different from cur majority

# Har ele ke passs 2 choice : 
# i) majority ele h. 
# is case me count ko bs increment karna h.
# ii) majority ele nhi h.
# is case me count ko decrease karna h and agar count == 0 ho gya decrease karne ke bad
# Then, majority ele ko update kar dena h current ele se and count = 1 kar dena h.

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = nums[0]  # Assume majority is nums[0]
        count = 1   # nums[0]

            if nums[i] == m:

                    count = 1
        return m


# Another way of writing the above code
# Best one
# on this approach, we can solve the Q :"229. Majority Element II".

# Just relate to real life counting of votes in ele i.e how a condidate wins.
