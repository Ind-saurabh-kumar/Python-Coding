# Time: O(n* l)  , n= no of words and l= length of each word.

# why Trie?
# We have to check all prefixes of a word is is present in the array or not.
# Higher length prefix will form by adding one letter(last one) to the just previous prefix.
# so we are getting all prefix by adding one letter to the already existing prefix(word).

# So if we insert all the given words and check for each word whether all its prefixes has 'isEndOfWord= True' or not.
# Since we have to check all its prefix so best data structure is Trie.

# So first insert all the words in the Trie and check for each word whether all its prefixes has 'isEndOfWord= True'.

# Note: Q in other words : "Given array of string and given another word . Check whether all the prefixes of this present in the array or not".
# we will do the same thing .

# Time: O(N * M), where N is length of words, M  is length of each word.
# Space: O(N * M)
