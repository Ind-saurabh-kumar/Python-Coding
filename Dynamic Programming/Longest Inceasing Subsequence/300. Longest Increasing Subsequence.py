# If we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem.
# Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. 
# Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. 
# Thatâ€™s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.

# Note vvvi: This is better one template in case of 'take' and 'notTake'  which there is 'notTake' option always there.

# How?
# There is no need to check the possibility of 'taking' and 'not taking' in possible case.
# There is always one choice to 'not take' and we can only take if follows the sequence.

# in case of pick and non_pick always write the pick case and non_pick case separately

# best one: using binary search to find the proper position of curr index in case not follows the pattern 
# and removing the curr ele at that index in 'subsequence'.

# How Binary search?
# Since LIS will be in strictly sorted order only.
# if cur ele follows the sequence i.e > pre added one then, we will add this directly i.e
# If 'num' is bigger than last ele of sub, we just extend our list 
# Otherwise, we will simply apply binary search to find the smallest element >= num and replace it.

# why this logic is giving correct ans?
# Ans: Replace karenge tb length to wahi rhega but smaller ele se replace karne pe next ele ka append hone ka chance increase kar jayega.
# kyonki chota se replace kar rhe. e.g: [2, 8] next ele is '3'. 
# after replacing => [2,3] ab agar next elements '3' se large hua to append kar denge directly,
#  but agar [2,8] hota tb sirf '8' se bda wale ko hi append kar pate. 
# Append kitna jayda ho rha last me wahi mera length ko increase karega..

# Note: if we will use 'bisect_right' then we get duplicates also if 'num' is already  in 'sub' so using 'bisect_left'
#  since we need to replace with smallest ele in sub >= num.
# If we use 'bisect_right' then, it will replace with next greater ele than 'num', so we may get duplicate like pre and num will be same only.

Some data analysts at Amazon are analyzing the outliers in data that contains two co-related features. 
The features are represented as two arrays of n integers each, feature1, and feature2. 
A data set is considered free of outliers if for any two indices iand/where 0 â‰¤ i < j < n,
 if feature1[i] > feature1[j]. then feature2[i] > feature2[j] or if feature1 [i] < feature1[1],
   then feature2[i] < feature2[j].

Note that if feature1[i] = feature1[j], then the data set is not considered to be free of outliers.

Given the arrays, feature1 and feature2, find the length of the largest array of indices 11, 12, 13... ik, 
such that data formed by these indices i.e. [feature1[11], feature1 [i2]....feature1[ik]]
 and [feature2[11], feature2[12]....feature2[ik]] is free of outliers.

Suppose n = 5, feature1 = [4, 5, 3, 1, 2], and feature2 = [2, 1, 3, 4,5].

It is optimal to choose the indices [3, 4]. The data for feature1 is [1, 2]
 and for feature2 is [4, 5]. Here feature1[0] < feature1[1] and feature2[0] <feature2[1], 
 therefore the condition holds true. Since is it not possible to select a larger subset 
 without violating the conditions, the answer is 2 i.e. the size of the chosen subset. 

 e.g: 
 feature1 = [4, 5, 3, 1, 2]
feature2 = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
 output = 2
 
 feature1 = [ 1,2,3,4,5], feature 2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
output = 1

feature1 = [3, 2, 1], feature2 = [6,5,4]
