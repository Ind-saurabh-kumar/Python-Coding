Above logic only just used element value directly instead of index.
i) Subproblem: We want to know whether itâ€™s possible to form a subset with a sum j using the first i elements of the array.
ii) State Definition: Let dp[j] be a boolean that tells us whether a subset with sum j is possible.
iii) Transition: For each element num in the array, if dp[j - num] is True, then dp[j] should also be True. 
This means if we can form a subset with sum j - num, then by adding num, we can form a subset with sum j.
iv) Initialization: dp[0] = True, since a sum of 0 can always be formed with an empty subset.
