# In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] 
# which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
#  Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
# find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of 
# this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 
# Note: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1) property

# method1: by recursion
# just like subsequence and subset. basically we are finding this only from the value array

# Logic: For every ele we have two choice : 1) include that or 2) Not include that
# we can only include if sufficient weight in bag is available.

# Time Complexity: O(2^n), no extra space but recursion  O(n)
