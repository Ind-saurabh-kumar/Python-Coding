# Note: In one semester you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.

# E.g: in 1st sem you can study all those courses which is not dependent on any course i.e doesn't require any prerequisite.
# in other way courses having indegree == 0
# in 2nd sem , we can study all those courses whose prerequisite courses has been already studied i.e courses having indegree == 1
# and so on.

# Note: for better visulation draw diagram.

# Ans: the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses is determined by the longest acyclic path, i.e, 
# we are looking for the longest acyclic path with each edgeâ€™s weight being 1.


# Observation: prerequisite thing(means topological sort) + longest/shortest path with equal weight (bfs)

# Note : In other words wew can say it is forming levels and we have to find last level i.e level at which last course exist.

# for level wise , we can use multisource bfs.
# Can use simple bfs also, in this case take one more vaiable length in queue and one more variable to update the ans.

# Only converted the code of topogical sort into multisource bfs.
