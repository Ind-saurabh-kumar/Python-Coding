# logic: All elements must lie between [min(nums), max(nums)] when all will be equal.

# Note: the goal of this problem is to "find a num that makes the sum of moves minimum".

# Note vvi: 'target' ele must be from one of the given nums only.
# e.g: Well, you say, if our array is [2, 5], what if we can achieve min cost by making them 3 or 4?
# For this to be the case, the cost for both 2 and 5 must be the same. 
# But if the cost is same, we can achieve the same min cost if we pick 2 or 5.

# Brute force: Just caculating the cost of making all ele equal in above range.

            ans= min(ans, curCost)

# Method 2: 
# Little bit optimising the above solution.
# Taking only element of same array and making them equal.

# Method 3: 
# Optimising using binary Search

# Assume the final equal values are x
# the total cost function y = f(x) is a convex function(upward parabola) i.e 
# there will be only one value for which this will be minimum on the range of [min(A), max(A)].

# To find the minimum value of f(x),
# we can binary search x by comparing f(mid) and f(mid + 1).  (adjacent value)

# If f(mid) >= f(mid + 1),
# the minimum f(x) is on the right of 'mid' so make start = mid + 1
# where x >= mid + 1

# If f(mid) < f(mid + 1),
# the minimum f(x) is on left of mid including 'mid',
# where x <= mid.

# Repeatly doing this while left < right,
# until we find the minimum value and return it.

# Note vvi: This method is known as ternary search, if we check f(mid1) and f(mid2).

    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:

        ans = f(start)
        while start < end:
            x = (start + end) //2  # just mid only

# method 3: Weighted median

# logic: Think of the cost array as the weight of the corresponding num in the nums array. 
# For example when nums = [1, 3, 5, 2] and cost = [2, 3, 1, 14], suppose we want to increase 1 in nums to 2, 
# we know that the cost for this operation is 2. However, this is equivalent as 
# if there are two 1â€™s in nums and we increase both of them to 2 with cost of '1'. 
# Therefore, the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal is equivalent 
# to the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array 
# nums = [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] become equal, 
# with the cost of doing one operation on each element being 1.

# Note : so As such, the answer to this question is the :
# total cost for moving all elements to the (unweighted) median in the new (collapsed) array.

# Note vvvvi: If the cost for all element is the same, then the minimum cost is when all numbers converge at the median.
# Since the cost is not the same, we need to find a weighted median.

# How will find the 'weighted median'?
# To find a weighted median(target), we sort elements, "repeating" each element based on its weight.
# For nums: [1,3,5,2], cost:  [2,3,1,4] case, the repeated array looks like this: [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,5].

# Note: Now aggregate the current weight going from one side, and stop when current > total // 2.

# After that calculate the cost of making all ele equal to this 'target'.

class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = sorted(zip(nums, cost))
